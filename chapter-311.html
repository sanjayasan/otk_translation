<p>Ellie tilted her head at my question.<br>
“Well… it’s so out of the blue.”</p>
<p>After dinner, Hyun‑joo noona explained, chewing nicotine gum instead of lighting a cigarette.<br>
“We were about to sign Hollywood star Catherine Tyler as the model. Contract was inches away. Then the president saw Ellie, fell head over heels, and switched.”</p>
<p>She added that, for CFs, top Korean actors and Hollywood names command roughly similar fees.</p>
<p>I glanced at Taek‑gyu. “What do you think?”<br>
“Why ask me?”<br>
“Because lately you’ve been freakishly good at calling things.”</p>
<p>To Hyun‑joo: “If Ellie says yes, does Golden Gate get selected as IPO lead?”<br>
“Most likely. Terms are comparable either way.”<br>
“If the deal size is 300 billion won, even the fee is chunky.”<br>
“We’re taking it in warrants instead.”<br>
“At the offer price?”<br>
“At the offer price.”</p>
<p>That saves the issuer cash; the bank makes more if post‑IPO price rises. “And if it drops?” she shrugged. “Then we basically did it for free.”<br>
She said that, but if they’d truly expected a flop they wouldn’t structure it this way; odds favored a rise.</p>
<p>“We’re fine either way,” she said. “It’s not like we’re desperate.”<br>
Ellie said, “Still, I think it’s worth doing. In the IPO market, this is a rare big catch.”</p>
<p>Ellie likes sports—she even dives. The brand fit. “As long as it’s not a bikini shoot, right?”<br>
“No need to worry,” Hyun‑joo said. “Bikinis aren’t their main product.”<br>
Ellie hesitated. “I don’t know if I’ll do well. But part of me wants some pretty photos while I’m still young.”</p>
<p>She accepted. Golden Gate Korea beat KYB to become Vester’s underwriter.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Post‑Christmas, companies slid into year‑end mode, but the mood wasn’t festive. Domestic demand was soggy; the headlines, gloomier. The hottest topic was Korea–Japan relations.</p>
<p>Seoul scrapped the comfort‑women deal from the Park administration. Korea’s Supreme Court ruled that Japanese firms bore liability for forced‑labor victims. Tokyo fumed. Foreign Minister Okamoto declared the treaty “final and irreversible,” threatened that Japan would not tolerate Korea’s “unilateral breach,” and warned of “strong measures” if Japanese firms were sanctioned.</p>
<p>It leaked into economics. Currency‑swap restart talks stalled amid insults. “Korea rips up treaties as easy as lunch,” Finance Minister Matsukata scoffed. “Who’d lend them money? We don’t need to extend favors only to Korea.” Talks froze.</p>
<p>A currency swap lets two countries exchange currencies at a set rate for a time. For Korea, access to yen—considered a safe quasi‑reserve currency—boosts confidence, like expanding FX reserves. Japan doesn’t exactly need won, but stable won is good for Japan: a won crash would goose Korea’s export competitiveness, overlapping with Japan’s. Stabilizing the won helps Japan too.</p>
<p>But Korea wasn’t begging: domestic demand was weak, yet the current account hit record highs every quarter and FX reserves were ample. If anything, the won was too strong.</p>
<p>Japanese politicians took turns flogging Korea; now and then the old claim over Dokdo popped up. It helped the cabinet’s approval rating. Prime Minister Okazaki’s numbers were sagging under scandals and gaffes, but after the anti‑Korea push they bounced back sharply.</p>
<p>Then, an incident.</p>
<p>2:30 a.m., a road in Chicago. A man in black suddenly ran out. The car—an AD1, autonomous mode engaged—braked and swerved, but a collision was unavoidable. 911 arrived quickly, but the man died en route.</p>
<p>He was Yoshizawa Masao, a Japanese student. He was drunk; his friends couldn’t stop him from bolting into the road. The car had a green light and kept to the limit. The insurer placed 100% fault on the pedestrian.</p>
<p>It should have ended as one of many tragic traffic accidents. But Japanese politics and media turned it into a referendum on Karos’s autonomy.</p>
<p>The foreign minister blasted us. Toyota’s chairman said, “Imperfect technology is a lethal weapon.”</p>
<p>In the U.S., reactions were mainly: *this was unavoidable.* The popular car show &lt;i&gt;Top Motor&lt;/i&gt; recreated the scenario. Even *knowing* someone would jump out, you couldn’t stop in time. People who watched the dashcam agreed:</p>
<p>– Is that a person or a deer?<br>
– How do you avoid that?<br>
– Even Michael Schumacher couldn’t.<br>
– Tragic, but not an autonomy failure.<br>
– Why is Okazaki losing his mind?<br>
– If you’re drunk and jump into traffic, what exactly are they investigating?</p>
<p>Japan demanded we disclose complete driving data and even our algorithms.</p>
<p>While Daryl and I debated how to respond, something flashed before my eyes.</p>
<p>When I came to, Taek‑gyu was staring. “What did the foresight say?”<br>
“OTK will acquire fourteen million nine hundred seventy thousand shares of Toyota for fourteen million nine hundred seventy thousand yen.”<br>
“How many shares outstanding?”</p>
<p>I checked on my phone. 149,582,550. If OTK acquired 14.97 million, that was over ten percent—top shareholder, instantly.</p>
<p>But the price: 14.97 million *yen*—about 170 million won—for ten percent?</p>
<p>“…Unless you misread the zeros,” Taek‑gyu said.<br>
I shook my head. “No.” It was exactly what I saw.</p>
<p>Then it hit me. I snapped my fingers. “Fat finger.”</p>
